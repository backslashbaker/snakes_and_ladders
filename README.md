# Snakes and Ladders Kata

This is a snakes and ladder kata from https://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/snakesandladders-kata. Snakes and Ladders is a board game involving two or more players rolling dice in order to move their tokens across a board.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

As this is a command line application you would need to have a terminal to run both the tests and application. If using Apple Mac I recommend using iTerm (https://iterm2.com/). You will also need the lastest verion of Ruby installed on your machine.


## Running the tests

To run the automated tests you will first need to install Rspec on to your machine.

```
gem install rspec
```
to run the actual test ensure you're on the home directory and run the rspec command. This will automatically run all the test files found in the 'spec' directory.

```
rspec
```
